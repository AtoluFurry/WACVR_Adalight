# WACVR
A plan of WACCA VR emulator

## Current stage:
- Successfully started the game itself
- Semi-successfully initialized touch
- Successfully send touch signal
- Successfully enabled Freeplay and tested the touch signal in game

## Current issue
- touch startup will fail. need to enter test mode to reconnect the touch panel

## Quick guide
- Port binding is same as my other repo MaiDXR
- need to enter test mode to reconnect the touch panel
- add "[touch] enable=0" to ini file

## Why this repo now?
I don't have much time and enough skills to make this project by myself. I'm not familiar with Unreal Engine etc. So I want this project to be a community project.
