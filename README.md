# WAC-VR
A plan of WACCA VR emulator

## Current stage:
- Successfully started the game itself
- Semi-successfully initialized touch
- Successfully send touch signal

## Current issue
- Cant insert coins

## Why this repo now?
I don't have much time and enough skills to make this project by myself. I'm not familiar with Unreal Engine etc. So I want this project to be a community project. If someone has managed to make the game work, I will continue developing.
